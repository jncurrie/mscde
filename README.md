## What is 'openness'?

When discussing how openness has changed digital education, we must first consider: what is ‘openness’? The term’s multiplicity of meanings often require defining ‘open’ in terms of what it is _not_: not closed, not hidden, not protected. The open education movement originally focused on the 'not closed' interpretation, and the virtues of ‘opening up’ higher education to all by leaning on the orientational metaphor “good is up” (Lakoff, 2003, p.16)[^1]. However, some applications of openness to digital education fall short of these utopian ideals and have led to unintended consequences.

In this essay, I use four ‘openness’ analogies to help illuminate the changes and challenges it has brought to digital education, with a particular focus on Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs). In the first section, using the imagery of ‘open doors’, I investigate the promise of increased access to education and how it has in fact led to other closures. In the second section, I use the analogy of an ‘open kitchen’ restaurant to consider how certain facets of teaching and learning are privileged by MOOCs and others are concealed. In the third section, the concept of the ‘open seas’ is employed to explore both the possibilities and vulnerabilities of educational technologies. In a fourth and final section, I suggest that the complexities of openness in digital education may best be represented by the notion of curiously exploring an ‘open question’, encouraging a positive view regarding the issue’s inherent uncertainties.

## 'Open Doors': Access and Inequality

Education, particularly higher education, has historically been seen as ‘closed’ and elitist, with the barriers of academic, financial, and geographic requirements preventing entry to many students. There is a long-established narrative of technology being able to ‘open doors’ and widen participation by “addressing and reducing social inequalities” (Facer and Selwyn 2021)[^2]. Open and distance universities first helped reduce these obstacles by offering non-competitive admissions and freedom in students’ physical and temporal locations, and digital technologies have been integrated into this ability to ‘learn from anywhere’. The open education movement is also now closely associated with the free, online provision and sharing of copyright-free open educational resources (OERs) and practises (OEPs), which may be single resources, such as videos or lesson plans, right up to full curricula and courses. Currently, the most mainstream OERs are MOOCs provided by technology companies such as Coursera, edX, Udacity and FutureLearn. With their stated goal of mass participation in education, MOOCs, while positioning themselves as ‘new’, are still focused on ‘opening doors’, by “removing economic and geographical barriers” (Farrow, 2017, p.134)[^3] and offering courses for which “there are no requirements in terms of prior qualiﬁcation” (p.132)[^3].

However, online OER repositories and MOOCs are only ‘open’ to those with the technology required to access the internet, and remain ‘closed’ to those without. In today’s postdigital world, inequality of technology use is, however, no longer a divide between the ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots’. New inequalities of opportunity described by van Deursen and van Dijk (2019)[^4] are dependent on the devices, software and connections used to access the internet, with an economic dimension to the number and diversity of devices available. Hogkinson-Williams and Trotter (2018)[^5] highlight the global inequality of this materiality: OER adoption relies on “access to stable electricity provision, functional computer hardware and affordable broadband connectivity” (p.210)[^5], levels of which vary both between and within countries. Additionally, Singh, Sharma, et al. (2021)[^6] point out that “effective online participation will also depend on access to a physical space to use the technology” (p.136)[^6], including a usable private, quiet study space, and this can vary independently of wealth.  Online ‘virtual’ learning spaces such as MOOCs are in fact “embedded in users’ physical surroundings” (Ibid., p.135)[^6] and therefore students cannot be said to have an equal online experience even if their material access opportunity is the same.

Openness in digital education causes another closure in shutting out those lacking the digital literacy required to find and use OER effectively. Drawing on Bourdieu’s (1986)[^7] concept of mutually reinforcing capitals, Halford and Savage (2010)[^8] describe how the cultural capital of technical skills “might allow the accumulation of other capacities” (p.945)[^8], such as political or labour market advantage. It is not just having or acquiring these skills that conveys an advantage, it is also having “access to contexts in which these [skills] can be used effectively that is important” (Ibid.)[^8]. The physical and technical ability to access and complete a MOOC, for example, may not be advantageous if the credential gained is unable to be used locally, or not held in as high a regard culturally as other qualifications.

Furthermore, openness has often ignored or entrenched old inequalities, for example, the “proliferation of hegemonic English-language OER” (Hodgkinson-Williams and Trotter, 2018, p.207)[^5] which limits their accessibility. OER use is unevenly distributed and benefits accumulate to those already privileged: they are “most often used by those already receiving a high-quality education” (McMillan Cottom, 2015, 27:08)[^9], and the majority of MOOC students live in developed countries and already have university degrees (Christensen et al, 2013, p.6)[^10]. Far from the oft-touted idealism of widening participation and reducing barriers to entry, ‘opening the doors’ of education using digital technologies has in fact caused more doors to close.


## 'Open Kitchens': Transparency and Concealment

The openness movement tends to assume that barriers to educational access “are the only issues preventing the instinctive and effortless uptake of self-directed learning” (Bayne et al., 2015, p.248)[^11]. A humanistic view of students as “rational […] and highly motivated individuals” (Ibid.) is related to the ‘learnification’ of education (Biesta, 2010)[^12], prioritising what and how students wish to learn over the guidance and knowledge of professional teachers, which “reconﬁgures or maintains particular notions of learning, teaching, and human being” (Bayne et al., 2015, p.248)[^11]. MOOCs tend to reinforce this model, viewing students as consumers and casting teachers mainly as facilitators of a student’s educational journey. Although openness may have opened some doors, the use of digital technologies can “reconfigure rather than simply overcome” closures (Edwards, 2015, p.253)[^12].

The consumerisation of education leads me to explore this shift using the analogy of an ‘open kitchen’ restaurant, where chefs prepare and cook food in front of diners, the customer makes choices and expects good service, but also where the entire concept and layout of the restaurant has been _reconfigured to foreground specific aspects_ of the meal creation process (Dana, 2019)[^13]. Similarly, MOOC providers promote student choice and encourage reviews of their ‘service’ but, due to the need to teach at scale, allow only certain pedagogies to be showcased. For example, open kitchens change chef behaviour by privileging the highly visual and ‘theatrical’ aspects of cooking over more mundane activities, and MOOCs also tend to privilege ‘edutainment’ and the performance aspects of teaching, depending heavily on highly-produced short-form video lectures to ‘engage’ students. The analogy is not perfect, since, for instance, teachers may often fulfil both roles of ‘chef’ (creating content) and ‘wait staff’ (delivering content), but an examination of other similarities helps reveal some further aspects of openness in digital education and MOOC culture.

In an open kitchen restaurant, the customer may only passively observe the chef cooking and cannot question their process, and likewise MOOCs generally do not allow for interaction between teachers and students, with the teacher positioned as an ‘unchallengeable’ authority figure. Also, in the same way that placing focus on the chef’s actions may lead customers to interact less with their fellow diners, an instructivist style of teaching discourages MOOC from learning with or from their fellow participants. It also leads to the de-emphasis or elimination of other teacher capabilities, including facilitating discussions, helping students “turn content into knowledge” by applying information to their individual contexts (Cottom, 2015, 20:27)[^9], and pastoral care. This individual-centred approach has led to concerns regarding the “implicit de-professionalisation of teaching” along with “problematic forms of student isolation” (Bayne et al, 2015, p.248)[^11] which contribute to the low completion rates of MOOCs (Hone and El Said 2016)[^14].

Despite the external rationale for open kitchens being offering customers transparency of the culinary process, much of the work of restaurant staff remains hidden, not least ‘low-status’ jobs such as dishwashing (Dana, 2019)[^13]. The customer does not see the chef creating menus, selecting and buying ingredients or preparing and storing food. Likewise, the up-front work required to produce OERs remains hidden, eliding the value of teacher labour (Winn, 2015)[^15] and MOOCs are often taught by “precariously-positioned teaching associates rather than well-paid academics” (Bayne & Jandric, 2017, p.21)[^16]. Furthermore, the tacit assumptions inherent in a restaurant setting, such as the type of cuisine on offer and required eating utensils, mirror the ‘hidden curriculum’ of OERs: it is not just the content being shared but also the values and customs of the creators. OERs often assume a “one-size-fits-all approach” (Collier and Ross 2017, p.11)[^17] which can exacerbate inequalities, due to the majority of OERs being created in the Global North and embodying Western ideals of education (Hodgkinson-Williams and Trotter, 2018, p.207)[^5].

The internal rationale for open kitchens is often one of efficiency (Dana, 2019)[^13], by the elimination of ‘wasted’ space which can be turned over to more customer seating; however, the drive for increased capacity may overlook more transient functions of that space. Likewise the benefit of MOOCs to providers in not requiring expensive campus buildings is tempered by the loss of valuable social interactions which take place in “intermediate liminal spaces” (Nordquist and Laing, 2015, p.340)[^18] such as corridors, staircases or campus squares which are not easily replicated online. A further efficiency gain lies in the reduction of necessary wait staff, as the chef can serve the customer directly. This elimination of a mediating presence mirrors how teaching at scale has efficiency as perhaps its highest goal: the ‘direct-to-consumer’ model allows a single MOOC to have enrollments in the tens of thousands, and multiple instances of the same course can run concurrently. The ‘engineering out’ of teacher contact time on MOOCs, both by prioritising conservative pedagogies that don’t require it and by replacing some teacher functions with artificial intelligence, is a result of the neoliberalism that views the ‘cost’ of the teacher as a problem to be solved (Ball & Grimaldi, 2021, p.14)[^19].

## 'Open Seas': Possibility and Vulnerability

Educational policy entertains a certain ‘frontierism’ in how technologies could change education for the better (Vincent-Lancrin, 2021, pp. 19-41)[^20], apparent in the cyclical promotion of digital technologies as the ‘next big thing’. MOOCs themselves have already travelled through the “hype, hope and disappointment” cycle described by Selwyn (2011, p.62)[^21]. Adopting imagery of ships on the ‘open seas’, initial forays in open, mass-scale education via early university-led iterations focusing on collaboration and connectivism (cMOOCs), led to the widely-heralded launches of platform MOOCs (xMOOCs) that would “disrupt” traditional education (Weller, 2015, p.4)[^22], followed by disillusionment when their limited capacities were realised. After more than a decade, MOOCs now appear to be on set bearings as providers of mainly professional training alongside partnerships with traditional universities - ironic, considering openness’ initial stance against such ‘elite’ institutions. The ‘open seas’ of digital education promise ‘limitless’ possibilities to users, but also render them vulnerable to the larger forces of platform capitalism and neoliberalism, and the risks of ‘exposure’ surrounding data privacy and ethics.

A near-horizon possibility lies in the current trend of MOOC platforms supplementing their ‘no-cost’ model with ‘low-cost’ branded micro-credentials (Weko, Kato et al., 2020, p.11-12)[^23]. Bourdieu’s notion of symbolic capital (1986)[^7] helps illustrate that not all credentials carry the same value: if a student pays for a MOOC with a view to increasing their cultural capital, perhaps in order to gain economic capital via a better paying job, then a MOOC ‘certificate of completion’ will be worthless to them unless employers can recognise it, trust its quality, and rank its equivalence against traditional qualifications. By partnering with ‘legitimate’ institutions, platforms are beginning to offer these assurances of capital, and countries such as New Zealand are starting to recognise “quality-assured MOOCs or OER” as credit-bearing credentials (Hodgkinson-Williams and Trotter, 2018, p.211)[^5]. Furthermore, there is potential synergy with new blockchain technology to create “user-controlled digital credentials” that can be easily and internationally verified (Smolenski, 2021, p.209)[^24]. 

On the other hand, the MOOC platforms’ drives for efficiency are only possible because research on the ‘big data’ generated by participants “has granted great power to large-scale computational analyses of learner behaviours” (Collier and Ross, 2016, p.26)[^24]. This power imbalance leaves users open to harm; Enyon (2013) urges particular caution around the challenges of ethics, what can and cannot be done with data, and inequality (pp. 238-239)[^25]. Data privacy laws offer limited protections, but the affordances of big data include its use in surveillance (Vincent-Lancrin, 2021, p.32)[^20]. MOOC use of learning analytics risks denying student personhood and autonomy via the inherent belief that what can be measured, and only that, is “valuable in terms of understanding learning” (Collier and Ross, 2017, p.25)[^24]. The current relative lack of regulations surrounding AI, which is “seamlessly embedded in virtually every aspect of the MOOC ecosystem“ (Fauvel and Yu, 2018, p. 24)[^26], creates a risk that undetected algorithm biases become ‘baked in’, entrenching inequalities. The environmental damage from technology manufacturing processes and disposal, along with the “vast energy requirements” required by data processing and storage are unsustainable (Facer and Selwyn, 2021, p. 15)[^2]. The ‘open seas’ are fraught with danger.

## 'Open Questions': Uncertainty and Curiosity

Critics have highlighted the inherent ‘certainty’ in essentialist views of both openness and digital education. Farrow (2017) mentions proponents of a “‘pure (authentic) openness movement” (p.136)[^3] and Facer and Selwyn (2021) caution against the “allure of the ‘technical fix’” (pp. 8-9)[^2]. MOOCs are emblematic of the focus on absolutes and short-term thinking processes that has, for decades, repeatedly positioned education as a ‘problem’ that can be ‘solved’ with openness, technology, or both. Instead, by rejecting the need for certainty and approaching these topics as an ‘open question’, one with no single fixed solution, we can better embrace the ambiguities and “messiness” (Collier and Ross, 2017, p.11)[^24] of education.

Ross and Collier (2016) use the term "not-yetness" (p.19)[^27] to describe a state of working amidst the perpetual promises of emerging technologies and practises without either naivety or cynicism. Education is a “highly situated, contextual, human and unpredictable endeavour” (Facer and Selwyn, 2021, p.17)[^2]  and its challenges are both reflective of, and intertwined with, complex societal issues. A reconsideration of early connectivist-style ‘cMOOC’s, and a posthumanistic rethinking of how we assess effective learning, might alleviate some of the pedagogic issues discussed in previous sections. The adoption of the “transformative responses” suggested by Hodgkinson-Williams and Trotter (2018, p.219)[^5] would better address global inequalities in education. However, any new practises must “acknowledge and work with complexity” (Ross and Collier, 2016, p.19)[^27]  in order to create realistic and sustainable improvements.

## Conclusion

This essay offered a perspective on how openness has changed digital education, particularly the development of MOOCS, by considering four different interpretations of ‘open’. This approach certainly has limitations, including a focus on MOOCs over other forms of OER, and cultural biases in the analogies used. However, I hope that the explorations still provide a useful illumination of the tension between ideals and realities. The idea of ‘open doors’ was used to illustrate MOOC providers’ attempts to widen participation in education, but which create yet more closures. The perceived transparency of an ‘open kitchen’ restaurant was depicted to show how certain pedagogies are privileged by MOOCs, while other aspects of educational work remain concealed. The nature of the ‘open seas’ was used to illuminate both the possibilities of MOOCs, such as micro-credentials, along with vulnerabilities arising from their use of big data. Finally, the concept of an ‘open question’ was used to highlight the benefits of embracing complexity and uncertainty, rather than relying on ‘techsolutionism’. We can be open-minded and curious, as well as cautious, about the future possibilities of openness and digital education.
