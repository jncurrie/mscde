# What is 'openness'?

When discussing how openness has changed digital education, we must first consider: what is ‘openness’? The term’s multiplicity of meanings often require defining ‘open’ in terms of what it is _not_: not closed, not hidden, not protected. The open education movement originally focused on the 'not closed' interpretation, and the virtues of ‘opening up’ higher education to all by leaning on the orientational metaphor “good is up” (Lakoff, 2003, p.16)[^1]. However, some applications of openness to digital education fall short of these utopian ideals and have led to unintended consequences. 

In this essay, I use four ‘openness’ analogies to help illuminate the changes and challenges it has brought to digital education, with a particular focus on Massive Online Open Courses (MOOCs). In the first section, using the imagery of ‘open doors’, I investigate the promise of increased access to education and how it has in fact led to other closures. In the second section, I use the analogy of an ‘open kitchen’ restaurant to consider how certain facets of teaching and learning are privileged by MOOCs and others are concealed. In the third section, the concept of the ‘open seas’ is employed to explore both the possibilities and vulnerabilities of educational technologies. In a fourth and final section, I suggest that the complexities of openness in digital education may best be represented by the notion of curiously exploring an ‘open question’, encouraging a positive view regarding the issue’s inherent uncertainties.

# 'Open Doors': Access and Inequality

Education, particularly higher education, has historically been seen as ‘closed’ and elitist, with the barriers of academic, financial, and geographic requirements preventing entry to many students. There is a long-established narrative of technology being able to ‘open doors’ and widen participation by “addressing and reducing social inequalities” (Facer and Selwyn 2021). Open and distance universities first helped reduce these obstacles by offering non-competitive admissions and freedom in students’ physical and temporal locations, and digital technologies have been integrated into this ability to ‘learn from anywhere’. The open education movement is also now closely associated with the free, online provision and sharing of copyright-free open educational resources (OERs) and practises (OEPs), which may be single resources, such as videos or lesson plans, right up to full curricula and courses. Currently, the most mainstream OERs are MOOCs provided by technology companies such as Coursera, edX, Udacity and FutureLearn. With their stated goal of mass participation in education, MOOCs, while positioning themselves as ‘new’, are still focused on ‘opening doors’, by “removing economic and geographical barriers” (Farrow, 2017, p.134) and offering courses for which “there are no requirements in terms of prior qualiﬁcation” (p.132).

However, online OER repositories and MOOCs are only ‘open’ to those with the technology required to access the internet, and remain ‘closed’ to those without. In today’s postdigital world, inequality of technology use is, however, no longer a divide between the ‘haves’ and ‘have-nots’. New inequalities of opportunity described by van Deursen and van Dijk (2019) are dependent on the devices, software and connections used to access the internet, with an economic dimension to the number and diversity of devices available. Hogkinson-Williams and Trotter (2018) highlight the global inequality of this materiality: OER adoption relies on “access to stable electricity provision, functional computer hardware and affordable broadband connectivity” (p.210), levels of which vary both between and within countries. Additionally, Singh, Sharma, et al. (2021) point out that “effective online participation will also depend on access to a physical space to use the technology” (p.136), including a usable private, quiet study space, and this can vary independently of wealth.  Online ‘virtual’ learning spaces such as MOOCs are in fact “embedded in users’ physical surroundings” (Ibid., p.135) and therefore students cannot be said to have an equal online experience even if their material access opportunity is the same.

Openness in digital education causes another closure in shutting out those lacking the digital literacy required to find and use OER effectively. Drawing on Bourdieu’s (1986) concept of mutually reinforcing capitals, Halford and Savage (2010) describe how the cultural capital of technical skills “might allow the accumulation of other capacities” (p.945), such as political or labour market advantage. It is not just having or acquiring these skills that conveys an advantage, it is also having “access to contexts in which these [skills] can be used effectively that is important” (Halford and Savage, 2010, p.945). The physical and technical ability to access and complete a MOOC, for example, may not be advantageous if the credential gained is unable to be used locally, or not held in as high a regard culturally as other qualifications.

Furthermore, openness has often ignored or entrenched old inequalities, for example, the “proliferation of hegemonic English-language OER” (Hodgkinson-Williams and Trotter, 2018, p.207) which limits their accessibility. OER use is unevenly distributed and benefits accumulate to those already privileged: they are “most often used by those already receiving a high-quality education” (McMillan Cottom, 2015, 27:08), and the majority of MOOC students live in developed countries and already have university degrees (Christensen et al, 2013, p.6). Far from the oft-touted idealism of widening participation and reducing barriers to entry, ‘opening the doors’ of education using digital technologies has in fact caused more doors to close.

# Basic usage

## Image

_Girl with a Pearl Earring_ (Dutch: Meisje met de parel) is an oil painting by Dutch Golden Age painter Johannes Vermeer, 
dated c. 1665. Going by various names over the centuries, it became known by its present title towards the end of the 
20th century after the earring worn by the girl portrayed there.[^1]


## Map

The work has been in the collection of the Mauritshuis in The Hague since 1902 and has been the subject of various 
literary treatments. In 2006, the Dutch public selected it as the most beautiful painting in the Netherlands.
